Stock Hawk
===================================

Stock Hawk allows users to track the current price of stocks. This project is a part of the Android Developer Nanodegree
As part of this project, I added the following enhancements to an existing app:

* Added a detail view which includes a graph that plots the stock's value over time.
* Ensured errors were handled gracefully
* Built a widget for the home screen
* Added support for screen readers
* Made optimizations for localization
